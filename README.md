# Image-Processing-in-eye-tracking-using-matlab


Eye Tracking project is a Matlab program that localizes the eye centers and plots the estimated circle on the screen using Viola-Jones algorithm for face detection and finding the approximated center of the eye using some geometry and filters. The program is thought to work in real-time with any laptopâ€™s camera, such those you can find on PCs, tablets and smartphones. This project can be useful in many applications like alert systems for sleeping drivers if he closes his eyes, rather than blinking, or tracking the eye for some games with human interface and so on.
